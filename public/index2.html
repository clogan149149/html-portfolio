<h1>Best Movies of All-Time According to Chris</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Warrior</h3>
<p>
  This is one of my favorite movies because not only is it entertaining, it also
  hits personally close to home.
</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
  This movie was just flat-out amazing! From the acting, to the story, the Joker
  and Batman are portrayed in such an entertaining way.
</p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>
  This movie has the perfect combination of action and comfort. I would not
  recommend many other movies as background noise.
